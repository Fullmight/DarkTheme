<h2>Tier Explanations</h2>

<p><b>S Tier:</b> Able to do all game content effectively (maybe room for one or two minor exceptions) and is one of the best options for playing at least some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>A Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is among the best options for playing some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>B Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is not among the best options for playing most game content optimally except for very specific niches.</p>

<p><b>C Tier:</b> Is good in some Niche, but there are better options for most game content, both generally and for optimal squad play.</p>

<p><b>D Tier:</b> Notably weak, and usually isn&rsquo;t even the best or second best option in it&rsquo;s own niche.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, all warframes and Archwings (although I won&rsquo;t be covering them here) are perfectly serviceable for the majority of game content. However their differences in relative power are still quite large.</p>

<p>The order of warframes within a tier is random.</p>
