<p>Tier Explanations</p>

<p>S Tier: Able to do all game content effectively (maybe room for one or two minor exceptions) and is one of the best options for playing at least some game content optimally.</p>

<p>A Tier: Able to do most game content effectively, and is among the best options for playing some game content optimally.</p>

<p>B Tier: Able to do most game content effectively, and is not among the best options for playing most game content optimally except for very specific niches.</p>

<p>C Tier: Is good in some Niche, but there are better options for most game content, both generally and for optimal squad play.</p>

<p>D Tier: Notably weak, and usually isn&rsquo;t even the best or second best option in it&rsquo;s own niche.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, all warframes and Archwings (although I won&rsquo;t be covering them here) are perfectly serviceable for the majority of game content. However their differences in relative power are still quite large.</p>

<p>The order of warframes within a tier is random.</p>

<p>A: Chroma, Excalibur, Gara, Harrow, Inaros, Mag, Mesa, Mirage, Nidus, Octavia, Saryn, Volt,</p>

<p>B: Atlas, Ash, Frost, Ivara, Nezha, Nekros, Oberon, Titania, Valkyr, Wukong, Zephyr</p>
