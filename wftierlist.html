    <h1>Warframe Squad Tier List</h1>

<h2>General Notes</h2>
<p>This tier list is meant for some combination of pub and premade group play. While many Warframes would maintain their rating in a solo tier list
many others would move positions. As such I am working on a separate solo tier list. The most obvious difference is that in solo play, tank and CC have far more value.
Tank is still worth more than CC, but you need to survive content somehow, and without group members to distract enemies and revive you occasionally on fuckups, these things
are much more important.

</p>

<h2>Tier Explanations</h2>

<p><b>S Tier:</b> Able to do all game content effectively (maybe room for one or two minor exceptions) and is one of the best options for playing at least some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>A Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is among the best options for playing some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>B Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is not among the best options for playing most game content optimally except for very specific niches.</p>

<p><b>C Tier:</b> Is good in some Niche, but there are better options for most game content, both generally and for optimal squad play.</p>

<p><b>D Tier:</b> Notably weak, and usually isn&rsquo;t even the best or second best option in it&rsquo;s own niche.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, all warframes and Archwings (although I won&rsquo;t be covering them here) are perfectly serviceable for the majority of game content. However their differences in relative power are still quite large.</p>

<p>The order of warframes within a tier is random.</p>
