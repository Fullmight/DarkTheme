    <h1>Warframe Solo Tier List</h1>

<h2>General Notes</h2>
<p>This tier list is meant for solo Gameplay. It's very different for the most part from regular group play tiers.
    The big difference here is that I'm going to be considering tank and CC as key features for frames entering the S
    and A tiers. Self-sufficiency is also a key feature in S tier and somewhat in A tier. I'm still valuing CC lower than raw Tank,
    at least for the majority of CC which slows down mission progress. A few frames have forms of CC which speed mission
    progress instead, such as Nidus. On average, I'd say most frames are "better" in solo play, in the sense that you
    don't have any reason to bother about what's going to help the most to finish missions faster in a squad, and can instead
    just value "not dying," which makes all the otherwise kind of bad CC frames of which there are many, fairly good in this
    situation. Keep in mind that tier list ratings are still relative to other frames in the same context.

    Small note just for Zephyr, she had a higher group rating purely for PoE quests, which commonly bug out and auto
    fail if you're flying above them solo. :\

<h2>Tier Explanations</h2>

<p><b>S Tier:</b> Able to do all game content effectively (maybe room for one or two minor exceptions) and is one of the best options for playing at least some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>A Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is among the best options for playing some game content optimally.</p>

<p><b>B Tier:</b> Able to do most game content effectively, and is not among the best options for playing most game content optimally except for very specific niches.</p>

<p><b>C Tier:</b> Is good in some Niche, but there are better options for most game content, both generally and for optimal squad play.</p>

<p><b>D Tier:</b> Notably weak, and usually isn&rsquo;t even the best or second best option in it&rsquo;s own niche.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, all warframes and Archwings (although I won&rsquo;t be covering them here) are perfectly serviceable for the majority of game content. However their differences in relative power are still quite large.</p>

<p>The order of warframes within a tier is random. Warframe's with * after their names are due to additional testing and likely
placement adjusting.</p>
