<p>
  I've finally got a dark theme going with Jekyll and a custom landing page. It really took me a helluva lot longer to get this site up and running than you might expect, but that was mostly because I stubbornly tried to work this in with rails for the heck of it.
</p>

<p>I think I might revisit that idea in the future mostly for practice. I kinda expect someone is going to want a site that actually can utilize rails as well as an integrated blog at some point and this isn't a terrible option. Although really I think I'd need a better editor for any non-programmer customer.</p>

<p>I guess if you are reading this I ought to introduce myself and my goals with this blog while I've got you here.</p>

<p>I'm Cameron Pickerill-Trinitapoli (quite the mouthful right?) and I usually go by fullmight everywhere on the internet where regular names look out of place. I've half-heartedly want to write amount my experiences in programming and doing related work that might be helpful to others for a long time, but been too lazy to do it. I've recently started picking up a lot of languages and technologies required for web development and that gave me the excuse I needed to make this site and start posting.</p>
